# Mini App Project

<li> to run the app just execute `app.py` file

# Week 1
In this week we'll be building out the foundation of your app, in particular, the UI aspect. This will make use of your ability to print to the screen, clear the screen,
accept user input, and create a basic list data structure.

## Week 2
Now that our app can create and list products, it should be simple enough to do the same for couriers. We'll also dump our data into .txt files so we don't lose it. Try
to ensure code that writes or reads from a text file is separated from the code that prints a list for example.
We'll also add a couple of basic unit tests.

## Week 3
So far we've been using one-dimensional lists of data, however, this won't work for orders. We need to store more information such as the customer's name, address
and phone number, as well as the status of the order, the courier etc. To solve this we'll use a two-dimensional data structure, a dictionary . We won't be able to
read/write this structure to text file anymore, but we'll fix this later. For now we'll also skip adding products to the order.
We'll also write a unit-test that covers the update order status functionality.
